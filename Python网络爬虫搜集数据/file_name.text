[1]I got it yesterday and it gave me free stuff
[2]Questo gioco credo sia la miglior app per cellulare perché non serve nemmeno spendere soldi perchè c'è l'auto-farming che ti da molte cose che ti servono, lo consiglio a tutti questa app passatempo!
[3]I get it there’s a lot of servers so it tends to be hard to keep up however don’t keep making servers if it’s gunna slow down every single server you cannot go 2 minutes without having to force close the app so much so actually that i had to delete this game despite spending so much money on it if i could get a refund i would this is probably the worst game in the App Store to date don’t download this game and if you put yourself through that torture atleast don’t give them your money they really don’t deserve it thanks for being a piece of trash and taking my money and in return giving me terrible servers 🖕
[4]Addicting took me a few worlds but pretty even based and ADDICTING... anyone need help look me up....
[5]Game is great but after seeing its newest advertisement kind of shocked you guys were that dumb. In your advertisement when talking about all the times you can upgrade and play your game and one was “Upgrade while driving”. ?!? Nobody should be doing anything like this “While driving”. So your new advertisement I gotta say...that ain’t it chief.
Yeah the game looks cool, but when I got it. HOLY COW was I wrong, don’t play this game!
Good game
