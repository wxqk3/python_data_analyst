Es macht sehr viel Spaß!! Der einzige Nachteil ist, dass man nach 20min Spielzeit 8 Stunden nichts machen kann!!! Bitte um Verbesserung!
Great game, but right after you start it’s hard to kick off
Easy to follow and play. Good time waster.
False advertising the game is nothing like the adds it is a fun game but falsely advertising your game is just low. something should really be done about it bad work ethic if you feel you need to lie to people to get them playing just shameful Ann dishonest will be deleting your game.
Really fun and super nice that you don't have to be glued to your phone all day for progress!!!
Amazing authentic add. Not many games are honest in there advertising but you described your game just like it is
It’s fire
This game is amazing however Norma is impossible to defeat in arena in idle heros
It was fun until the game clearly became pay to progress and pay to win. While yes you can progress while offline, you must put hours into the game to be remotely competitive. It’s nothing like the ads (shocking!) merge three heroes get a new one? Nope! there’s complicated merging that must be met and sometimes only during events.Bottom line — do not download.
After the new update I lost my account. And customer service doesn’t do anything, don’t get this game or spend money on it

Idle heroes 🦸‍♂️ is a great epic game but I’ve got toSay that there are many games what are just like it like lordsMobile boom beach clash of clans and more I’m enjoying this game I love your games and your animations

可以玩一玩的消遣游戏。
首先，这两颗星是给你们的宣传动画的，游戏真的做的一点都不好，虽然是收菜类游戏，但是一天只能玩五分钟也是没谁了。礼包各种坑，不氪真的玩不了。养老玩家不推荐，土豪的话对不起打扰了
感觉还行冲了好多钻

活动送的高召，就是扯淡……新手可玩性极低，不充钱，根本玩不了。
This game is so amazing so easy and realy fun! The battles are on auto you can level up your heroes and summon more I don’t wanna spoil the rest just play it!
Most of my Facebook group feel the same way, there’s just nothing exciting about it anymore. Plus they have gone the way of pay to play. I think I’ll be deleting soon. And tell the group to do so as well.
Stop making your ads look like a different game... that it’s not. That’s click bait-ish and it’s misleading
I been searching everywhere for the dragon scale shop. where is it at?
Idle heroes is a really well built Idle game. Probably the best idle game I’ve ever seen. A lot of idle games don’t have nearly as much content and a crazy lot more ads crammed into the game. The only reason I left off a star is because of the advertisements for this game in other games. The ads state wrong things about the game, for instance, in the ad, the player turns a 1 star foolish hero into a 10 star max level das moge. First of all, you wouldn’t get a hero straight up max level from the prophet tree, it would be level one. Second of all, the prophet tree only turns unwanted heroes into heroes, OF THE SAME STAR RATING.
The only game i have found that doesnt punish you for having a life outside the game.
I’m a free to play player and I have a lot of progress but it goes faster if you are dropping like 20 bucks every month but it’s still fun :)
Jaime bien ce jeu rien a dire continue comme ça

It’s is a amazing game I love it so much it’s very fun and joyable to play with friends so many different heroes to pick from I’ve all ways wanted a game like this
This game is one of the best if not the best idle games out there today and I hope it will above and beyond the rest although it may be a little slow that doesn’t matter because it makes up for it’s insane graphics gameplay and chances I mean you can go to the creation circle who thinks of that stuff? No one that’s why this game is the best but they should boost up the chances for 5 stars a little more
It is yeeeeeet bois
I enjoy this game quite a bit, it’s great for passing time, and the art is really good. I think that the developers did a really good job on the game, and I haven’t experienced any situations in which I am overwhelmed with it trying to get me to buy something, which I like a lot  over many other games. I also like that your progress isn’t dependent on making purchases, and you don’t miss out on exclusive characters or anything by not purchasing anything, which I think is great. There are also many really good deals in the game if you want to buy something, like spirit or gems. Overall I enjoy the game as a whole quite a lot. The developers did a very good job.
This game is very fun and very addicting but sadly it is beginning to die plz play the game
Top!
楽しいです
I got it yesterday and it gave me free stuff
Questo gioco credo sia la miglior app per cellulare perché non serve nemmeno spendere soldi perchè c'è l'auto-farming che ti da molte cose che ti servono, lo consiglio a tutti questa app passatempo!
I get it there’s a lot of servers so it tends to be hard to keep up however don’t keep making servers if it’s gunna slow down every single server you cannot go 2 minutes without having to force close the app so much so actually that i had to delete this game despite spending so much money on it if i could get a refund i would this is probably the worst game in the App Store to date don’t download this game and if you put yourself through that torture atleast don’t give them your money they really don’t deserve it thanks for being a piece of trash and taking my money and in return giving me terrible servers 🖕
Addicting took me a few worlds but pretty even based and ADDICTING... anyone need help look me up....
Game is great but after seeing its newest advertisement kind of shocked you guys were that dumb. In your advertisement when talking about all the times you can upgrade and play your game and one was “Upgrade while driving”. ?!? Nobody should be doing anything like this “While driving”. So your new advertisement I gotta say...that ain’t it chief.
Yeah the game looks cool, but when I got it. HOLY COW was I wrong, don’t play this game!
Good game
面白いと思うが、広告の詐欺が酷すぎる
Superb
能退订吗？没个星期都扣钱。很烦
极度相似
游戏不错，装备要合上去的，慢慢升级中
看了半天评论，有一条是跟游戏有关的。刷多少是凑字数的，刷五星又如何，游戏推广又不止这一条路，每一天评论都是乱打字，有意义吗
说是放置类游戏，但放置收菜那点资源不是游戏核心，收菜的金币只用于英雄等级提升和点公会科技…这个游戏不氪金的确是可以达到氪金的高度的，简单来说你一分不氪肝一年的强度差不多等于你三个月氪个几千块钱。这个游戏需要大量的五星本体和五星狗粮（用作融合的英雄），英雄想满级基本要上百个五星本体+狗粮，而获取一个狗粮平均用时一周左右。大家可以算算你如果想得到一个满级英雄要玩几个月（年），而这个游戏基本在满级以后才算开始

嗯
真的好玩好玩好玩
This game is awesome but my one problem is I wish it could be played with no WiFi
I love it. It is a very fun and challenging game!
I love this game so much. It’s pay to win to a degree but not completely. It’s completely able to play without buying anything but at some point you’re going to hit a brick wall & progress very slowly.
This game all about money if you have money you can play easily . You cant evolve fastly this game running forever I’m not recommending .
I think there should be more places to go like going to the underworld or heaven and that can be like a place with a new campaign and blacksmith tavern etc... in my opinion I rate this a 7/10 because it is hard to level up in some points of the game but the game is still good and you should play it
要花钱的都不是好游戏。
豹子头零冲
It’s game it’s so nice because you can just AFK!
Pretty good
I hate ads and I’ve gotten like 100 for this stupid game and the devs are greedy, I’ve never played before because it would be a waste of time and all the paid actors are so bad
Ok I am very surprised at the quality of this game because from what the adds looked like your game looked like crap however I was proven wrong when downloading this game, It was great news to hear that this game unlike other idle games actually wasn’t pay to win garbage!!! 5 stars
This game is amazing!!! BUT, Everytime I try to collect loot, get exp & money with the (green get) button it freezes up. Everytime I try to collect my daily login it freezes up. I have a iPhone 7, my husband has a Android LG, it freezes up the exact same way with him. Please fix this game. Too amazing and fun to have bugs!!!  Thank you
I think this game is a ehhh or no because first of all tell me why I lost my data.Second what’s the point of playing when it plays for you?And third i feel like your copying clash and clans when you get that island.(by the way clash of clans is the best)And that is why I think this is a ehh or no game.But I mean it’s decent to other games if I’m bored.
Ya, this game sucks because too much helicopter.  Like let me play the damn game.  If I make a mistake I will figure it out.  I just want to understand the game play and the only way to do that is to figure out where I am in the game.Low and behold I get some awful box that blocks my whole site.  Btw, I’m. A girl so a sexy NPC isn’t really attractive when all I want is the hit of dopamine from winning or at least attempting to.
I enjoy it, play for a bit, close the app, then do whatever thing you have to do. Once you open the app again you’ve gained or done something, it’s pretty neat!
Un buen juego
Please use for turkish lira.Dollar is too expensive.Turkish player dont wanna dollar for purchase.

遊戲問題怎處理？更換物品沒有拿到
Muito bom
เพลินดี

gm和托太多了，烧钱，游戏模式单一，最低68rmb消费最高648人民币无限充值次数，游戏里不能直接打出游戏名称，是否有猫腻，是没代理权吧？
只有肝这一条路了
置换了n次都不一定是你想要的英雄，就TM那几个英雄，不能排着来，英雄碎片在9-5打了3天都TM一个碎片都打不到，真tm无语了
注册能给5星英雄 特别厉害
我之前下过，为什么再下载的时候，之前的注册没有了，所有的一切都是重新的
I love this game.
Hey I like the game very much i have it in my Android device and I very recently got a iPhone so I downloaded dile heroes again and put my Gmail and password but it said that there was problem and didn’t let me link my acc to my iPhone and to make sure it wasn’t my password I reset it and still didn’t work.
Very fun game  but I try 10 times to friend my brother and I can’t
